# The Challange

```
Create a function that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.
```

# My Answer

```
- See .py file
```

# Comments & Hurdles

- Overall happy with my first attempt at a NumPy project
- On first attempt only thing I was missing was .tolist() to satisfy requirement
- Throwing error based on != 9 covers more than the requirement
- I could have used .reshape for a better 3,3 matrix
